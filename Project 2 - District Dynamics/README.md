## Introduction  

This project delves into housing market data, analyzing various factors such as **square footage**, **cost**, and **location** of properties. The goal is to uncover trends, identify potential **outliers**, and examine **influence points** that could significantly affect property values within different districts.

### 🔍 **What’s Included:**
- **Square footage**: Analyzing the relationship between the size of a property and its cost.  
- **Cost**: Investigating how property price correlates with location and size.  
- **Location**: Understanding how different areas impact the overall property pricing dynamics.  
- **Outliers & Influence Points**: Detecting data points that deviate from the norm and could have an outsized effect on the overall model.

### ⚙️ **Related Skills**:  
- Hypothesis Testing  
- Outlier Detection  
- Statistical Inference

This project is **actively under development**, and more features, visualizations, and analysis will be coming soon. Stay tuned for updates!


Feel free to come back when I am finished!
